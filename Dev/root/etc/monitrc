# Start monit in the background (run as a daemon) and check for
# services at 5 second intervals, delaying the first check for 15
# seconds.

# Establish the port, bind address and access restrictions for the
# internal HTTP daemon that supports IPC between the client and
# daemon.

# Set logging to syslog with the 'daemon' facility.

# Set the location of monit ID file which saves the unique ID specific for a
# given monit. The ID is generated and stored on first monit start.

set idfile /var/run/monit.id

# Set the location of monit state file which saves the monitoring
# state on each cycle. If state file is stored on persistent file
# system, monit will recover the monitoring state across reboots. If
# it is on temporary file system, the state will be lost on reboot.
