#    Description:
#      This file is the control and configuration file for the
#      daemon-monitoring daemon, monit, for the DBus daemon.
#
#      The DBus daemon cannot effectively be restarted, so we
#      define dummy start/stop programs and request a reboot
#      when the daemon failure is detected.
#

check process dbus-daemon with pidfile "/var/run/dbus/pid"
  start program = "/bin/true"
  stop  program = "/bin/true"
  if 1 restart within 1 cycle then exec "/sbin/reboot"
